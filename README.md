# Zefset-Test

ZefSet-Test is a java based desktop application developed to conduct computer-based examination.

When the application starts, the student is required to enter his/her credentials (Name and Roll No.) followed by a password, provided by 
the invigiltor before the start of the exam. As soon as the exam starts, the new screen appears displaying the important instructions which must be kept in mind by the examinee. On pressing the start button, the exam session starts alongwith the timer. The exam finishes either when timer goes off or the student answers all the questions and deliberately chooses to submit his/her answers.

After the submission, a text file is created which keeps a record of the examinees answers.
